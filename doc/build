build steps 
===========

All build steps are defined in .ini files.
Environment variables are defined in <todo: put default config location> and
optionally modified in .ini files.

+ prepare
  - not containerized, uses binaries from /home/xx/bin
  - example actions: extracting tarballs, patching, editing files and paths

+ configure
  - containerized to /tmp/xx/<build set name>
  - example actions: running configure scripts, editing config files

+ build
  - containerized to /tmp/xx/<build_set_name>
  - example actions: compiling the program

+ pkg_create
  - containerized to /tmp/xx/<build_set_name>
  - example actions: creating a pkg in /home/xx/prog/<prog_name>

+ install
  - not containerized, uses binaries from /home/xx/bin
  - action: copying pkg files and setting permission in target root dir



ini file spec
=============

+ general rules
  - each build step is concatenated to one line and then executed in bash
    (no need to escape newlines or any other characters; each command needs to
    be separated either by ';', '&&' or '||' even if they're placed on separate
    lines)
