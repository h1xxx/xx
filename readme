---- xx ----
============



general info
============

A source-based linux distro with emphasis on console, security, and simplicity.

WARNING: xx is in early stages of development. Everything should work, but not
necessarily. The documentation is also not guaranteed to be updated.

If for some reason you'd like to run this distro please let me know - I will
double check if everything compiles as expected and update the docs.



features
========

+ linux console as the main working environment
  - desktop environment: tmux
  - multimedia packages compiled without xorg support, but instead with
    drm/framebuffer support
  - xorg with a shell in dwm/st readily available from a container, but
    mostly only to connect to qemu virtual machines via vnc or spice
  - large gui programs (firefox, libreoffice, gimp etc.) expected to be run
    temporarily and in a single window mode with seamless switching between
    xorg and linux console (work in progress)

+ clean system
  - lean, statically compiled, musl-based main system
  - complex, glibc-based software (xorg, mpv, w3m etc.) deployed to containers
  - minimal system without many packages unnecessary from a single user
    perspective (sudo, nls, pam etc.)
  - designed for relatively low maintenance 

+ security
  - minimizing attack-surface by radically reducing compiled features in
    programs and in the kernel
  - programs transparently executed in separate containers with restricted
    network access when not needed
  - designed for a single user - very limited use of suid binaries
  - hardened compiler flags

+ flexibility
  - git compatible configuration of all the components for multiple machines:
    kernels, programs, permissions, etc.
  - designed for easy, quick and reproducible, local and remote deployments
  - available binary packages from alpine and arch linux (work in progress)
  - quickly available, containerized and reproducible build environments

+ self-reliance
  - keeping all the source code and packages locally
  - main system bootstrapped from c
  - local, containerized builds without any network connection



support
=======

Unfortunately there is no support available for this distro. Users are expected
to investigate and fix issues with their setup by themselves.

Documentation requests and patches are very much welcomed.

Contact via irc on linuxconsole.net.



inspiration
===========

+ ms-dos
  - text-based user interface
  - each program is self-contained
  - graphical programs taking over the whole screen
  - designed primarily for an offline use

+ qubes
  - radical process separation

+ gentoo
  - compile flags and dependency info on package-flag combinations
  - recipes for package compilation

+ linux from scratch
  - cross compilation of initial toolchain and the final system afterwards
  - a lot of good info for many packages

+ oasis, sabotage, alpine, void
  - musl recipes and patches
  - general idea for a low maintenance and lean distro

+ openBSD, suckless software, musl
  - simplicity and elegance
