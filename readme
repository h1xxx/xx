---- xx ----
============


general info
============

A source-based Linux distro with emphasis on console, security, and simplicity.

WARNING: xx is in early stages of development. Everything should work, but not
necessarily. The documentation is also not guaranteed to be updated.



features
========

* Linux console as the main working environment

* security
  - minimizing attack-surface by compiling only needed features in programs
    and in kernel
  - programs transparently executed in separate containers with restricted
    network access
  - designed for a single user - limited use of suid binaries
  - hardened compiler flags

* flexibility
  - git compatible configuration of all the components for multiple machines:
    kernels, programs, permissions, etc.
  - designed for easy and reproducible deployments
  - available binary packages from alpine and arch Linux
  - quickly available reproducible build environments

* clean system
  - minimal system without many widely used packages (sudo, nls, pam etc.)
  - complex software deployed to containers
  - designed for relatively low maintenance 

* self-reliance
  - keeping all the source code and packages locally
  - builds without network connection



support
=======

Unfortunately there is no support available for this distro. Users are expected
to investigate and fix issues with their setup by themselves.

Documentation requests and git patches are very much welcomed. Contact via irc
on linuxconsole.net.



inspiration
===========

* ms-dos
  - text-based user interface
  - each program is self-contained
  - graphical programs taking over the whole screen

* gentoo
  - compile flags and dependency info on package-flag combinations
  - recipes for package compilation

* linux from scratch
  - cross compilation of initial toolchain and the final system afterwards
  - a lot of good info for many packages

* oasis, sabotage
  - musl recipes for package compilation
  - general idea for a low maintenance distro

* qubes
  - radical process separation

* openBSD, suckless, musl
  - simplicity and elegance
